# Jumanji
ECE 453: Computer Engineering Capstone
University of Wisconsin-Madison
Fall 2018

This project is a mechanical version of the original Jumanji board game, featuring magically moving pieces, a glowing LCD screen with riddles and dice, and fun jungle gameplay. The pieces will be moving by magnet- an xy-plotter moves an electromagnet underneath the board to then move the pieces to the correct positions, with little player input.
